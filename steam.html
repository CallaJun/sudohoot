			We the S. TEAM Committee (Science, Technology, and Engineering Advocacy for Mawrtyrs) and the Bryn Mawr College community, are writing you in hopes of addressing shortcomings identified by STEM students. We seek to improve the overall experience of STEM students at Bryn Mawr by improving academic support, career advising, and professional development opportunities through the collaboration of students, faculty, LILAC, The Quantitative Center, and the Undergraduate Dean's Office to refine and implement solutions through the appropriate channels.

		        		Approximately one third of Bryn Mawr students on campus are STEM majors. And yet, the Deans are typically insufficiently knowledgeable about STEM requirements, nor do any have a degree in STEM.  It is worth noting, however, that there is an entire Health Professions Advising Office for pre-medical students. While we recognize that faculty advisors are the best resource for major-specific advice, Deans are the primary and most trusted source for new and undeclared students for assistance with academic planning, course registration, and utilizing resources at Bryn Mawr. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		The lack of a Dean with scientific advising expertise has resulted in incorrect, inconsistent, or otherwise unhelpful advising for freshman and sophomore STEM students. There have been many reports of students who entered Bryn Mawr with an intended STEM major who then proceeded to take requirements in accordance with their intended major, only to find out in later semesters that they are unable to complete their degree requirements in four years. While one might argue that a student could overcome these difficulties by taking an additional semester or year of coursework, this is not a financial reality for many students. These students expressed that the realization of their inability to complete their intended major came as a surprise, citing the fact that they had planned their coursework with their Deans since the start of their college education. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		The issue of inaccurate advising preventing students from obtaining their intended degree has impacted Chemistry students very drastically compared to students in other departments, with multiple students surveyed from the class of 2017 and class of 2018 expressing that they needed to change majors. This is likely a contributing factor to the shrinking size of student majors in Chemistry (the class of 2013  had 20 graduates and the class of 2014 had 14, whereas the class of 2017 has 6). Considering the stringent requirements of the Biochemistry major, we imagine that poor advising may cause similar problems for Biochemistry majors as well, preventing future students from fully taking advantage of this new curricular opportunity. Clearly, there is little point to to this opportunity existing in the first place if students are unable to take advantage of it, despite their efforts to do so.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		In less drastic cases of advising shortcomings, students can complete their major, but nevertheless experience undue and preventable difficulty. For example, freshmen are often advised against taking concurrent laboratory courses as freshmen, even though this is unavoidable for certain science majors, particularly biology and chemistry. This results in more burdensome schedules and workloads for students in their later years, when the courses are advanced and substantially more difficult. Advising based in knowledge of the science programs at Bryn Mawr would plausibly improve the well-being of students and also serve the mission of retaining more women in the sciences. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		While freshmen and sophomore students have been the focus of this problem area, advising for upperclassmen is also an area of concern. Inevitably, within all departments, there are times of fluctuation due to faculty retirement, faculty going on sabbatical for research or personal reasons, the addition of new full-time or temporary hires, etc. In these moments of flux, the role of adviser may shift to faculty who may not have experience in advising, and who don't have a firm grasp on major and college-wide requirements. In this case, students must rely on themselves for advising because the Dean's Office and their own department are unable to provide information with certitude.  Students in the Chemistry department have, most recently, experienced this problem, with reports of some students consulting retired faculty for advice over e-mail. 
		        	</p>
		        	<strong>Proposed Solution for Problem Area 1:</strong>
		        	<ol>
		        		<li><strong>Hiring a Dean of Science</strong> who is knowledgeable of the coursework and requirements of each major, has substantial knowledge of on-campus resources pertaining to each field, and who can connect students to major representatives, faculty, and staff.</li>
		        		<li><strong>The addition of paid major-specific peer mentors who are current majors in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and geology</strong>. Peer mentors in non-STEM majors may be of relatively little help for STEM majors in providing advice or concrete academic strategies. Additionally, major representatives as they currently exist do not fill this void because they are very informal roles with inconsistent duties between departments.  Major-specific peer mentors could serve as true Points of Contact for newer students to gain insight from students experienced in navigating Bryn Mawr's STEM curriculum. This role could supplement advising from both the Dean's Office and STEM departments.</li>

		        		The shortage of faculty in the Computer Science Department has resulted in sparse course offerings, little to no research opportunities, and a lack of faculty availability to support and advise students. Additionally, major requirements have become more restrictive. As these issues manifest, the demand for the computer science major is steadily growing. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		Due to over-enrollment, Computer Science Majors often get lotteried out of required core classes. Introductory classes, additionally, lottery out many students interested in pursuing the major. Those who decide to major in computer science their sophomore year, if lotteried out of classes, face the risk of being unable to declare or pursue the major. Haverford is also experiencing over-enrollment due to the rise in popularity of the computer science major on their own campus, which they are in the process of dealing with by increasing the size of the introductory computer science courses and increasing lab TA hours.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		In the Spring 2016 semester, Bryn Mawr is offering no computer science elective courses, and yet the computer science major requires 6 electives for students to graduate. Newer incoming students are considering majoring at Haverford because it seems they will have to take most of their courses there. Additionally, aside from Algorithms, there are no offerings suitable for Bryn Mawr upperclassmen being taught in the Spring 2016. Thus, students must rely on Haverford courses that are increasingly over-enrolled, which places CS majors at serious risk of being lotteried out of required courses.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		The shortage of faculty fails to enrich the student's knowledge of computer science or enhance their educational experience. Due to the lack of faculty, existing computer science faculty are unable to involve students in their research or teach classes in areas of their unique expertise; teaching core requirements every semester takes precedence. Students have expressed that they are sometimes turned away when they ask for research opportunities, or that their research was largely unsupervised due to faculty time constraints. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		To exemplify the educational deficit students are experiencing, one professor in the CS department specializes in robotics research and has an entire robotics laboratory well-stocked with high-caliber robots. Even though this faculty member is interested in teaching robotics, has previously won and fulfilled a grant to develop robotics software at Bryn Mawr, and many computer science and non-computer science students alike would be interested in taking such a course, the faculty member is unable to  teach robotics courses or to further develop related curriculum. The last robotics course was taught in Fall 2011, and one will not be offered next semester, meaning Computer Science majors starting their education in 2011 or 2012, or even earlier, considering the pre-requisites, have been unable to take advantage of opportunities in robotics at Bryn Mawr. One of the primary benefits of attending a small liberal arts college for students is the opportunity to engage with faculty on an individual level, but this is greatly undermined by the faculty shortage.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		Finally, new restrictions on transfer credits into the Computer Science Department only allow a maximum of two credits, regardless of whether these credits are taken within Bryn Mawr's Tri-Co or Quaker Consortia -- at Swarthmore or UPenn -- or at any other external university, including universities abroad. Considering that study abroad students are advised to take at least two courses within the computer science major while overseas, this new requirement means that  students now have to choose between either taking classes at Penn and Swarthmore or studying abroad in order to realistically complete their major. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		One upperclassman student who reportedly came to Bryn Mawr for its reputed computer science program remarked that, if asked by a prospective student considering Bryn Mawr College for computer science, they would recommend that the prospective student attend a different university. It should be an active goal of Bryn Mawr to compensate for the increased popularity of the Computer Science major and to improve the experience of current majors who are unable to fully benefit from the College's resources.
		        	</p>
		        	<strong>Proposed Solution for Problem Area 2:</strong>
		        	<ol>
		        		<li><strong>Increase class size and, accordingly, reduce pressure on professors by incorporating graders</strong>. Possibly make lab components of certain classes optional and for additional credit. </li>
		        		<li><strong>Hire newer faculty immediately</strong> to alleviate difficulties faced by current computer science majors.</li>
		        		<li>If faculty searches are unsuccessful, evaluate whether hiring salary is competitive compared to other small liberal arts colleges.</li>
		        		<li>Consider eliminating or increasing the limit of elective courses that can be taken at UPenn, Swarthmore, or at international universities.</li>

		        		The Quantitative Center hosts courses in remedial math for students who are not sufficiently prepared to complete their quantitative distribution requirements at Bryn Mawr. The Quantitative Center hires tutors that have a wide range of mathematical expertise, and who are therefore capable of (and advertised as being capable of) tutoring students well beyond the remedial level. However, beyond that level, their expertise is rarely sought.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		Utilization of the Quantitative Center is primarily limited to those who have taken Quantitative Seminar or other Q-Center courses. This is due to the fact that most students and faculty are unaware of how the Center might be useful to them as a resource, and the fact that students and faculty  do not know where the Q-Center is located on campus. Indeed, even students working at the Help Desk at the Campus Center have expressed that they do not know where it is, even though the building is directly behind Campus Center. The Q-Center, as a likely result,  is seldom if ever recommended as a resource by STEM faculty. Students struggling in mathematics and quantitative aspects of the sciences would be better served if they were regularly informed of this resource and invited to take advantage of it. 
		        	</p>
		        	<strong>Proposed Solution for Problem Area 3:</strong>
		        	<ol>
		        		<li>The Q Center should, on a semester basis, send faculty from every STEM department an informative reminder specifying the mission of the Center, describing the support and resources offered at the Q-Center, contact information for their tutors, and a description of the location of the Center -- in addition to an urge for faculty to share this information with their students in class early in the semester.</li>
		        		<li>The Q-Center should improve its on-campus outreach through the use of posters,  particularly in the Park Science Building.</li>

		        		Despite the fact that Bryn Mawr has graduated a number of stellar scientists and engineers, Bryn Mawr graduates who have become leaders in STEM fields are rarely, if ever, celebrated for their careers, featured in broader on-campus events for their contributions to society, interviewed about their difficulties and experiences, or featured in LILAC-sponsored alumni Q&amp;A sessions, etc. As a result, it seems as though scientific discovery and technological development, except when tied to environmental activism (which is commonly featured), are not recognized as a valuable pursuits by the College. Furthermore, externships in the sciences, engineering, and technology are generally not offered outside of medicine, science writing, or the “soft” implementations of science. At an all-women's college, there would be much to gain from the College highlighting the persisting STEM gender gap and empowering students by connecting them with role models and mentors.
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		Additionally, there is no alumni database available to current students. The former database has been unavailable for nearly two years with no word about a replacement. Currently, students' only access to alumni data is indirect, through LILAC, but this is not advertised because the system is so flawed. The system is as follows: LILAC has access to a static Excel document that students are not allowed to see. In order to get information off of this database, students must know to contact LILAC about the excel spreadsheet in the first place, and then request information about a specific alumna. Then, if that alumna happens to have their information on the excel document, the student will be given their most recent contact information, which may or may not be up to date. This is very clearly not an efficient or accessible resource. While this issue is a concern for all students, due to the lack of other opportunities for STEM students to connect with alumni, it may impact them more severely. 
		        	</p>
		        	<p>
		        		The lack of visibility of Bryn Mawr STEM alumni hinders students from exploring the manifold of careers possible and from gaining access to valuable female mentors. The latter is particularly concerning because female mentors are often cited as a critical component to success for women entering male-dominated fields. 
		        	</p>
		        	<strong>Proposed Solution for Problem Area 4:</strong>
		        	<ol>
		        		<li>LILAC should, on a semester or yearly basis, send out a reminder to STEM faculty to suggest speakers and alumni who would be suitable for campus-wide talks or externships.</li>
		        		<li>LILAC or the appropriate body should provide students with an up-to-date alumni database as soon as possible so that students can realistically and feasibly make connections with alumni.</li>
		        		<li>When a new alumni database is formed, LILAC/CPD staff, should take a leading role in fostering alumni connections for the externship program.</li>
		        	</ol>

			We hope that the identification of these problem areas and our proposed solutions are a productive form of feedback. We recognize the great opportunities that Bryn Mawr has to offer and hope to assist the College in its continual efforts to improve itself. We thank you for your consideration.
